Duration
A duration object expresses a time span by means of a count and a period.

Internally, the object stores the count as an object of member type rep 
(an alias of the first template parameter, Rep), which can be retrieved by calling member function count.

This count is expresed in terms of periods. The length of a period is integrated in the type (on compile time) by its second template parameter (Period), which is a ratio type that expresses the number (or fraction) of seconds that elapse in each period.


Template parameters
Rep
    An arithmetic type, or a class emulating an arithmetic type, to be used as the type for the internal count.
Period
    A ratio type that represents the period in seconds.


Template instantiations
The following convenience typedefs of instantiations of duration are also defined in this namespace:
type            Representation                              Period
-----------------------------------------------------------------
hours           signed integral type of at least 23 bits    ratio<3600,1>
minutes         signed integral type of at least 29 bits    ratio<60,1>
seconds         signed integral type of at least 35 bits    ratio<1,1>
milliseconds    signed integral type of at least 45 bits    ratio<1,1000>
microseconds    signed integral type of at least 55 bits    ratio<1,1000000>
nanoseconds     signed integral type of at least 64 bits    ratio<1,1000000000>
----------------------------------------------------------------

Member types
The following aliases are member types of duration. They are widely used as parameter and
return types by member functions:

member type           definition                    notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
rep      The first template parameter (Rep)       Representation type used as the type for the internal count object.
period   The second template parameter (Period)   The ratio type that represents a period in seconds.
