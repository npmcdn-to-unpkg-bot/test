Tuple library

Tuples are objects that pack elements of -possibly- different types together in a single object, 
just like pair objects do for pairs of elements, but generalized for any number of elements.

Conceptually, they are similar to plain old data structures (C-like structs) but instead of having 
named data members, its elements are accessed by their order in the tuple.

The selection of particular elements within a tuple is done at the template-instantiation level, 
and thus, it must be specified at compile-time, with helper functions such as get and tie.

The tuple class is closely related to the pair class (defined in header <utility>): Tuples can be 
constructed from pairs, and pairs can be treated as tuples for certain purposes.

array containers also have certain tuple-like functionalities.
