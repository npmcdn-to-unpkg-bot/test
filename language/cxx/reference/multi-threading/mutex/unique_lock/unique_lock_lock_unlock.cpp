void lock();
Lock mutex
Calls member lock of the managed mutex object.

Calling lock on a mutex object that has already been locked by other threads causes the current thread to block (wait) until it can own a lock to it.

When the function returns, the object owns a lock on the mutex.

If the call to lock fails, a system_error exception is thrown.
