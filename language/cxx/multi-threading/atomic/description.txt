*Atomic*

Atomic types are types that encapsulate a value whose access is guaranteed to not cause data races 
and can be used to synchronize memory accesses among different threads.

This header declares two C++ classes, atomic and atomic_flag, that implement all the features 
                                      ^^^^^      ^^^^^^^^^^
of atomic types in self-contained classes. 
The header also declares an entire set of C-style types and functions compatible with the atomic support in C.
