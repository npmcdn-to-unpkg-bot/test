in cmake:
if Value is a list
set(Value 
    aa 
    bb 
    cc)
then:
    message(${Value})
    aabbcc    # all print without delimiter
    message("${Value}")
    aa;bb;cc  # with ;

The real solution is to use the list already in CMake.  It was a mistake 
to have CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS and CMAKE_C_STANDARD_LIBRARIES be strings they 
should have been lists.  If you want to convert a string to a list you 
can do it like this:

set(list ${string})

That will make the space separated list string into a ; separated list. 
  If you want to keep string a string you need quotes:
set(newstring "${string}").

Converting a list back into a string requires a foreach loop or a regex.
