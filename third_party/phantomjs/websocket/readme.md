also https://github.com/amir20/phantomjs-node is using
socket.io as a way to connect with phantomjs.

example:
https://github.com/sgentle/phantomjs-node currently uses SockJS
https://github.com/alexscheelmeyer/node-phantom currently uses Socket.IO
https://github.com/baudehlo/node-phantom-simple currently uses XHR long-polling (so no WebSockets involved)
